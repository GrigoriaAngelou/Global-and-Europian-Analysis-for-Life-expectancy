# Global-and-Europian-Analysis-for-Life-expectancy

In this project I use a dataset from https://ourworldindata.org/ which contains Life expectancy of all the countries for the years and Continents for the years 1543 to 2019. I am using jupyter Notebook to clean explore and visualize my dataset. I am also using IBM Watson Studio in order to make more interactive Dashboards.

## What is life expectancy? 
Life expectancy is the average life span of an individual. The term “life expectancy” refers to the number of years a person can expect to live. By definition, life expectancy is based on an estimate of the average age that members of a particular population group will be when they die. It is the key metric for assessing population health. But how this metric changes over the years? And how each continent perfoms? <br>
