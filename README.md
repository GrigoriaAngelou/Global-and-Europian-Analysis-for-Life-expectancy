# Global-and-Europian-Analysis-for-Life-expectancy

In this project I use a dataset from https://ourworldindata.org/ which contains Life expectancy of all the countries for the years and Continents for the years 1543 to 2019. I am using jupyter Notebook to clean explore and visualize my dataset. I am also using IBM Watson Studio in order to make more interactive Dashboards.
